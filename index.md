## Welcome

Free and open source solutions now exist for every component that is required to create a 4G cellular (LTE) network, all the way from the radio access network (RAN) and core, to services which are used for integrated voice (VoLTE). Creating a fully functional mobile network is the next logical step, but this requires overcoming the final remaining technical hurdles. 

This project will provide end-to-end integration of a FOSS technology stack for 4G networks, via a validated hardware and software configuration that is subjected to appropriate testing. Together with additional tooling and documentation for repeatable deployment, the project will making it far easier to create a self-contained 4G network than ever before. This is particularly timely given the availability of low cost software-defined radio (SDR) hardware, coupled with the efforts of wireless regulators to provide increased access to spectrum for private and community LTE networks.

### Details and roadmap

Further details, including an overall architecture and roadmap, will provided in due course (target 1st February 2021).
